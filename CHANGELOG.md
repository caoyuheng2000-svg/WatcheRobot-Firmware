## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.1.8] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Windows-first packaged release flasher under `tools/win_flasher` for scanning release ZIPs, selecting COM ports, and flashing with `esptool`
- Dedicated Windows release flasher documentation covering install, interactive usage, non-interactive commands, and common troubleshooting

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `v0.1.8`
- Current release packaging now includes the new Windows release ZIP flashing workflow and updated usage docs

### Notes
- Release focus: packaged Windows flashing and release validation workflow
- Runtime firmware baseline remains aligned with the latest `v0.1.7` mainline behavior fixes

---

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- BLE-to-WebSocket recovery memory storms are reduced during reconnect and runtime handoff
- Display text and font updates stay in sync more reliably with behavior state and WebSocket-driven UI changes
- UI state transitions are more resilient when local state updates and cloud state updates overlap

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `v0.1.7`
- Current release baseline now includes the merged BLE/WS recovery hardening and the latest UI state synchronization fixes from `main`

### Notes
- Release focus: BLE/WS recovery stability and UI state consistency
- `v0.1.7` is the recommended package for validating reconnect stability, state handoff, and on-screen text behavior together

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Dedicated Bluetooth feedback state with a matching animation pack and local Bluetooth SFX asset

### Fixed
- TTS playback recovery is more reliable after the audio path drops or switches away unexpectedly
- BLE-disconnect recovery now tries the last successful WebSocket endpoint before falling back to UDP discovery
- WebSocket reconnect recovery is less likely to stall on a fresh discovery cycle when the previous server endpoint is still valid
- Speaking and thinking SPIFFS action timing is refined for smoother motion during expression playback

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `v0.1.6`
- WebSocket client auto reconnect is disabled so the transport coordinator owns reconnect policy explicitly
- The flashing helper now prefers `export.ps1` so build and flash steps use the same ESP-IDF Python environment on Windows
- Current release packaging now reflects the latest animation, action, Bluetooth feedback, and audio recovery baseline on `main`

### Notes
- Release focus: Bluetooth feedback state integration, stronger TTS recovery, cached WebSocket resume, and cleaned-up speaking/thinking action curves
- `v0.1.6` is the recommended package for validating Bluetooth state feedback, TTS recovery, startup transitions, and action playback together

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Animation layering is more stable, with emoji overlays aligned correctly and the main animation recentered on the display
- SPIFFS-driven behavior actions are more resilient when an action clip is missing or a fallback path is needed
- Startup expression handoff is less likely to desync animation and action playback during bring-up

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `v0.1.5`
- Current release packaging and documentation are aligned around the repaired animation system and action system baseline
- This release also carries the latest servo interpolation and runtime stability fixes already merged on `main`

### Notes
- Release focus: animation system fixes, behavior action fallback hardening, and a clean test baseline for current mainline integration
- `v0.1.5` is the recommended package for validating expression playback, action triggering, and startup state transitions together

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Staged low-memory BLE-to-Wi-Fi recovery flow that can pause BLE advertising, reclaim optional cloud runtime memory, and retry Wi-Fi with a degraded largest-block threshold after repeated heap defers

### Fixed
- BLE and Wi-Fi recovery is more stable on low-internal-heap devices after BLE disconnects
- Recording start is less likely to trigger LCD flush `ESP_ERR_NO_MEM` failures when internal heap headroom is too small
- WebSocket runtime teardown now releases more resources cleanly before reconnect attempts

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `v0.1.3`
- WebSocket client runtime now uses smaller default buffers, dynamic client buffering, and PSRAM-backed audio frame storage to preserve internal RAM for BLE, Wi-Fi, and LCD DMA
- Listening animation assets were refreshed and the generated SPIFFS animation manifest was updated

### Notes
- Release focus: stable BLE provisioning and Wi-Fi validation on the current mainline
- `v0.1.3` is the recommended baseline for repeated BLE pairing, Wi-Fi provisioning, disconnect/reconnect, and recovery-path testing

---

## [0.1.2alpha] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- BLE-priority transport coordinator for cloud recovery after BLE sessions release control

### Fixed
- BLE / Wi-Fi / WebSocket handoff is more stable after BLE disconnects
- Cloud recovery path is less fragile during provisioning, reconnect, and local-control-first bring-up

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `0.1.2alpha`
- Main transport flow now prioritizes BLE control sessions while coordinating Wi-Fi resume, discovery, and WebSocket recovery in the background
- Current mainline also includes the earlier 3-click restart path and delayed input initialization improvements from `0.1.1`

### Notes
- Release focus: BLE-priority transport recovery and continued local bring-up validation

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Earlier physical restart availability through delayed input initialization immediately after boot UI setup

### Fixed
- Button-based restart no longer depends on cloud readiness before becoming available
- Boot-time input probing now emits clearer diagnostics around IO expander readiness and delayed input attachment

### Changed
- Physical restart trigger is reduced from 5 short presses to 3 short presses
- Runtime input initialization and restart callback registration now run after boot UI setup regardless of cloud connection state

### Notes
- Release focus: make local recovery and BLE-side bring-up easier during ongoing integration and provisioning validation

---

## [0.1.0-beta] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Beta release track for the current integrated `main` branch
- SPIFFS-driven behavior actions with guarded fallback for local expression execution
- Multi-device Codex lane flashing workflow for local parallel bring-up and repeated device testing

### Fixed
- Startup display sequencing and state handoff during cloud bring-up are more stable
- BLE provisioning path is hardened for first-time network setup and recovery after Wi-Fi cleanup
- WebSocket recording/upload path is more resilient during long audio capture and cloud handoff
- Local SFX playback now hands off to cloud TTS more cleanly during reply start

### Changed
- Firmware version is now tracked as `0.1.0-beta` for the current integration milestone
- Mainline audio path now favors smoother local SFX playback, safer TTS takeover, and more tolerant WebSocket timing
- Behavior state transitions now integrate animation, SPIFFS action playback, and safer fallback handling
- Local multi-device development workflow is now part of the beta bring-up path for `s3-a / s3-b / s3-c / s3-d` style rigs

### Summary
- This beta marks the first mainline milestone where voice, BLE provisioning, animation, local actions, and automated multi-device testing are all available together on the current integrated branch.
- The branch is suitable for ongoing joint debugging and integration validation, while the later stable `0.1.0` release remains reserved for fully completed end-to-end bring-up.

---

## [0.0.92] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- Local SFX playback now hands the audio path cleanly to cloud TTS instead of briefly switching back to recording mode during reply start
- Recording upload no longer drops the WebSocket connection as easily under low-memory UI load

### Changed
- Local SFX now prefers PSRAM prefetch with larger playback chunks to reduce SPIFFS read jitter and short stutters
- WebSocket TTS playback now streams fragmented binary audio frames directly and keeps fragmented text/binary state across packets
- Boot-time discovery now uses a bounded timeout so the device can continue startup in BLE-only mode when the cloud server is unavailable
- WebSocket recording/upload path now uses longer send/network timeouts, higher client task priority, keep-alive, and richer error diagnostics
- Listening UI is frozen to a static frame during recording to reduce animation pressure while voice data is uploading

### Notes
- Release focus: audio playback smoothness, TTS start handoff, and WebSocket stability during voice recording

---

## [0.0.91] - 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Removed the boot-time hardcoded hidden Wi-Fi credentials from firmware startup
- Boot now uses only stored STA credentials and otherwise waits for BLE provisioning to provide Wi-Fi

### Notes
- Release focus: Wi-Fi configuration cleanup for local device testing and BLE provisioning validation

---

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- WebSocket TTS playback now reassembles fragmented text and binary frames instead of dropping fragmented cloud audio
- Voice recording refuses to start until the cloud WebSocket session is ready, avoiding full-buffer upload failures before hello acknowledgement

### Changed
- WebSocket send failures now log the blocked state (`socket_connected` / `hello_ack`) to make cloud audio regressions easier to diagnose

### Notes
- Release focus: audio reliability for cloud ASR/TTS bring-up on the Watcher S3 test rigs

---

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- SPIFFS-based behavior action executor for core runtime states
- Watcher0327 animation asset pack and updated generated animation resources

### Changed
- Startup flow now integrates local SFX playback, behavior actions, and richer state transitions
- Animation playback is more stable across state updates and boot-time display transitions

### Notes
- This release bundles two major features:
  1. behavior action execution from SPIFFS
  2. upgraded animation/media asset pipeline
- Cross-feature integration is not fully validated yet; `0.1.0` is reserved for the fully integrated milestone

---

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Codex multi-device flash workflow for local three-device automation testing
- Device alias templates and lane metadata/log conventions for repeatable local test runs

### Changed
- `flash-monitor.ps1` now supports device alias resolution, bounded monitor sessions, and dedicated per-device build directories
- Input initialization is delayed until cloud ready to make boot-time behavior more deterministic during test runs

### Notes
- Release target: Bluetooth provisioning validation and local automated device testing

---
